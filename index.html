                <h3>Temple complex found in southwest China</h3>
           <p>
               
            In the complex, the researchers discovered a tile inscribed with the characters
             “Buddha sarira enshrined by the government,” which indicates that the Buddhist 
             relics of Nanzhao’s royal court are likely to have been enshrined and worshiped 
             inside the temple. The complex is therefore believed to be a major religious site
              of Taihe, said the institute.“Sarira” is a general term with a number of meanings, 
              but is generally used to describe the bodily remains after a Buddhist cremation. 
              The remains of Buddhist masters were often said to contain crystalline beads or 
              pearl-like objects.

                <h3>3,000 grave goods unearthed from Anglo-Saxon</h3>
           <p>
               
            Archaeologists have unearthed almost 3,000 objects from 154 burials 
            in an Anglo-Saxon cemetery in Overstone Leys, Northamptonshire. It is
             the largest Anglo-Saxon burial ground ever discovered in Northamptonshire.
              Most of the grave goods are jewelry, including 2,000 beads, 150 brooches, 
              15 finger rings, 75 bracelets and 15 chatelaines. There are also numerous 
              weapons — 25 spears, 40 knives, 15 shield bosses — and utilitarian items 
              like combs and cosmetic kits. Very rare textiles remains survived attached
               to some of the metal objects, mineralized by their corrosion.

                <h3>Marigold found with tobacco in Maya vessels</h3>
           <p>
            Nicotine residues have been found in small vessels indicating 
            they were used to hold fresh/dried tobacco rather than the products 
            of tobacco consumption (like spit from chaw, for example). The new 
            study analyzed the organic remains inside 14 miniature vessels of 
            four different forms ranging in date from 250-900 A.D. Twelve of the
             containers were excavated at various salvage digs over the past 15
              years in Mérida, Yucatan. Two were unearthed in 2016 at the archaeological 
              site of Ucanha.
